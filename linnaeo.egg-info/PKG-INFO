Description: # LINNAEO #
        
        Linnaeo is a python program I made mostly as an exercise in learning how to code GUI programs... but also to solve a
        basic problem I had: nothing out there is very good for storing and making protein alignments.
        
        
        ### Protein alignments? ###
        
        Yes, out there in the world are countless amino acid sequences, and their sequences are connected to
        protein functions... but it's often hard to see that. This program is intended to help with this
        by meeting a few basic criteria:
        
        1) It should be fast.
        2) It should store any sequence you want.
        3) It should be easy to create and store alignments.
        
        That's a basic idea. Most likely those criteria will change.
        
        ### How do I get set up? ###
        
        Current requirements and build process. Primarily building on Windows, but this should be nearly system-agnostic:
        
        Install Anaconda3 and create a new environment:
        
        ```
        conda create env --name linnaeo python=3.7
        pip install biopython, psutil, pyqt5=5.9
        # If on linux:
        pip install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/sci/clustalo/current/include/clustalo/" --global-option="-L/usr/local/sci/clustalo/current/lib/" clustalo
        # Windows:
        pip install ./INSTALL/clustalo...etc.whl
        
        # To actually build an executable:
        conda install rust, pyoxidizer
        ```
        
        PyOxidizer makes use of the pyoxidizer.bzl file to build! 
        
        
        I'm trying to get this into a conda package that can be installed easily (akin to PyMOL -- they figured it out somehow!). Here's hoping I am successful. If I am, I'll be sure to update that here.
