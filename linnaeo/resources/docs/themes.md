### THEMES

Linnaeo provides a variety of different themes for displaying amino acid properties in the sequence viewer. This document is designed to provide an explanation for those themes.

##### Linnaeo default theme

The default theme was partially inspired by Clustal X categories but with colors that were intended to be as easily readable as possible. Although not necessarily the best for quickly seeing unusual residues or differences, it may perhaps be the easiest on the eyes. 

Broadly speaking, residues fall under these core categories:

Hydrophobic:
* Leucine (L)
* Isoleucine (I)
* Valine (V)
* Methionine (M)

Aromatic:
* Tryptophan (W)
* Tyrosine (Y)
* Phenylalanine (F) 

Polar:
* Serine (S)
* Threonine (T)
* Aspargine (N)
* Glutamine (Q)

Positive charged:
* Arginine (R)
* Lysine (K)

Negative charged:
* Aspartate (D)
* Glutamate (E)

Miscellaneous:
* Cysteine (C)
* Proline (P)
* Alanine (A)
* Glycine (G)
