Welcome to **BIOGLOT**  -- the shitty app that I made!

UPDATE 2017: OH SHIT I'M DOING THINGS AGAIN!

### What is this repository for? ###

It stores my stuff. Namely this app.
The app is for viewing bio-related stuff. I hate paying for software, so obviously the next best thing would be to make one myself. Right now it: 

* Translates DNA sequences to Protein Sequences
* That's it?

Yay!

### How do I get set up? ###

Fuck if I know. Figure it out. How did you even get here? 

Stuff I used to make it that you'll probably need:

* Python v3
* PyQt5
* ??? 
* Etc

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines
* What are guidelines? 

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Me. Etc.
* Also me. There's no one else. It's just me.
