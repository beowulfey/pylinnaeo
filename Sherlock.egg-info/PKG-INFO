Description: # CODENAME SHERLOCK #
        
        Sherlock is a python program I made for learning how to code GUI programs, but also to solve a 
        basic problem I had: nothing out there is very good for storing and making protein alignments.
        
        
        ### Protein alignments? ###
        
        Yes, out there in the world are countless amino acid sequences, and their sequences are connected to
        protein functions... but it's often hard to see that. This program is intended to help with this 
        by meeting a few basic criteria:
        
        1) It should be fast.
        2) It should store any sequence you want.
        3) It should be easy to create and store alignments. 
        
        That's a basic idea. Most likely those criteria will change. 
        
        ### How do I get set up? ###
        
        I am going to try and make this into a package that installs automagically, but for now 
        here is a list of the packages I installed into a fresh python environment:
        
        * Python v3.8
        * PyQt5
        * biopython
        * A port of Clustal Omega (in this repository)
        * PyQt5-stubs==5.14.2.0 (for code hints)
        
        ### Contribution guidelines ###
        
        * Writing tests
        * Code review
        * Other guidelines
        * What are guidelines? 
        
        ### Who do I talk to? ###
        
        * Me. Etc.
        * Also me. There's no one else. It's just me.
